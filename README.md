# -Cross-Lingual-Transfer-Learning-for-NLP
 🌐 Cross-Lingual Transfer Learning for NLP

This project explores **Cross-Lingual Transfer Learning (CLTL)** using **Multilingual BERT (mBERT)** for low-resource language applications in NLP. It aims to create robust translation and sequence labeling systems using **zero-shot** and **few-shot** learning strategies.

📌 Motivation

Most NLP systems perform well in high-resource languages (like English or French) but fail for low-resource languages due to limited data. This project addresses this gap using CLTL to bridge performance disparity across languages.

🚀 Features

- ✅ Uses mBERT pretrained on 100+ languages  
- ✅ Implements Zero-shot and Few-shot learning
- ✅ Includes CRF for structured sequence labeling  
- ✅ Optional GAN integration for semi-supervised learning  
- ✅ Tested on multilingual datasets: OPUS, wikiAnn, Europarl, TED Talks

 🧠 Methodology

📚 Datasets Used:
- OPUS  
- WikiAnn  
- Europarl  
- TED Talks  
- Tatoeba

⚙️ Architecture Overview:
- `mBERT + CRF` for structured prediction  
- Optional: `GAN` to improve generalization  
- Preprocessing: Unicode normalization, BERT WordPiece Tokenizer, BIO tagging  
- Evaluation: SacreBLEU, METEOR, F1 Score

🧰 Tools & Frameworks:
- Python, PyTorch  
- Hugging Face Transformers  
- NLTK, SpaCy  
- Google Colab (for training)  
- matplotlib & seaborn (for visualization)

 📊 Results

| Language Pair          | Mode        | F1 Score |
|------------------------|-------------|----------|
| English–French         | High-Res    | ~90%     |
| English–Swahili        | Zero-Shot   | ~70–75%  |
| English–Tamil (1K samples) | Few-Shot    | +7–10% over zero-shot |

- BLEU score (low-resource): 18.4 (zero-shot) → 23.9 (few-shot)
- CRF boosts label accuracy
- GAN adds robustness in low-data setups
